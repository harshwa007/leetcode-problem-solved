SQL
Top 3 --> get top 3 feilds
SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;
Limit--> get only 
SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 1,2; //after 1 show 2 record
SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 3 // show top 3 record

SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

An aggregate function is a function that performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single value.

Aggregate functions are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement. The GROUP BY clause splits the result-set into groups of values and the aggregate function can be used to return a single value for each group.

The most commonly used SQL aggregate functions are:

MIN() - returns the smallest value within the selected column
MAX() - returns the largest value within the selected column
COUNT() - returns the number of rows in a set
SUM() - returns the total sum of a numerical column
AVG() - returns the average value of a numerical column
Aggregate functions ignore null values (except for COUNT()).


SELECT COUNT(*) AS [Number of records]
FROM Products;

Return all customers that starts with "b" and ends with "s":
A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string.

Wildcard characters are used with the LIKE operator. The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'b%s';

Return all customers that contains the phrase 'or'

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';

Return all customers that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%';


Return all customers starting with "a", "b", "c", "d", "e" or "f":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '[a-f]%';

Return all customers starting with either "b", "s", or "p":

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerName LIKE '[bsp]%';


Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table


JOIN Three Tables
The following SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information:

Example
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
FROM ((Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);




SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.

FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;



SELECT e.employee_name AS employee_name, m.employee_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;


SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;
